                    We collect various types of information to provide and improve our Services, to personalize your experience, and to communicate with you. This information can be broadly categorized into two types: information you provide to us directly and information we collect automatically.

                    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> When you contact us directly (e.g., via email, contact forms, or customer support), we collect the content of your communication, your email address, and any other information you choose to provide. This helps us to respond to your inquiries and improve our support services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong> If you participate in surveys, contests, promotions, or other interactive features on our Site, we may collect information you provide in connection with these activities.</li>

Please note that we typically use third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) who handle this data securely. We do not store sensitive payment card information on our servers.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect information about the device you use to access our Services, including the device model, operating system, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about your interactions with our Services, such as the recipes you view, the stories you read, the features you use, the time spent on certain pages, and the search queries you make. This helps us understand user behavior and tailor content.</li>

                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    We take the security of your personal information seriously and implement a variety of technical and organizational measures designed to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt data transmitted between your browser and our servers, particularly for sensitive information like login credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to personal data is restricted to authorized personnel who require it for legitimate business purposes and are bound by confidentiality obligations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Audits and Monitoring:</strong> We regularly review our security practices and monitor our systems for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We only collect personal data that is necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> Our employees receive regular training on data protection and security best practices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Despite our best efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any activities that occur under your account.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                    We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. The retention period may vary depending on the type of information and the purpose of processing.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> We retain your account information for as long as your account is active to provide you with our Services. If you delete your account, we will initiate the deletion of your personal data, though some residual copies may remain in our backup systems for a limited period (e.g., 30-90 days) due to technical constraints or legal obligations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Data:</strong> Content you submit (recipes, stories) may remain on the Site even after account deletion if it has been published publicly and is linked to the community's collective knowledge, unless you specifically request its removal and it is legally permissible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We retain anonymized or aggregated usage data for analytical purposes indefinitely, as it does not identify individual users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal and Compliance:</strong> We may retain certain information for longer periods if required by law (e.g., tax, accounting, or legal obligations) or if necessary to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or protect our legal rights.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>
                    Kitchen Verses operates globally, and your information may be stored and processed in countries other than your own, including in the United States or India, where our primary servers and operations are located. Data protection laws in these countries may differ from those in your jurisdiction.

                </p>

                <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Our Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kitchenverses.com">privacy@kitchenverses.com</a>.
                </p>

                    For example, if you share a recipe from Kitchen Verses on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, your interaction with those platforms is governed by their respective privacy policies, not ours.
